# cftp
**Controlled Frame Transmission Protocol over TCP**

CFTP is a lightweight and extensible framework for transmitting structured data frames over raw TCP sockets. Itâ€™s designed for real-time multiplayer applications, custom protocols, or any system that benefits from precise control over frame structure and delivery.

---

## Features

- Fast frame parsing and building using binary buffers
- Clean API for handling framed data transmissions
- Built-in ping mechanism with optional logging
- Encapsulated socket management for scalable design
- Fully minified and optimized for deployment

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install cftp
```

## Usage

<pre><code class="language-js">
const cftp = require("cftp");

const server = createServer({
  ping: { active: true, interval: 5000, ping: "ping sent" },
  logs: { connect: "Client joined", disconnect: "Client left" }
});

server.TCP(socket => {
  socket.data(frame => {
    console.log("Received:", frame);
    socket.broadcast("A Client Speaks: " + frame.payload);
  });
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("cftp server running on port 3000");
});
</code></pre>

## Structure

Each data frame follows this format:

- type: UInt8 (frame ID or opcode) | 1 byte (0-255)

- length: UInt16BE (payload length) | 2 bytes (0-65,535)

- payload: UTF-8 string (content) | n (length) bytes (0-2^n)
